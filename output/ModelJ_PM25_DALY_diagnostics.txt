========================================

Sample size: N = 54
Centering mean (ln PM₂.₅): 2.4628
Centering mean (PM₂.₅): 11.74 μg/m³

Coefficient on z (linear): 2.099557
Coefficient on z² (quadratic): -1.107563

Curvature: concave (diminishing marginal harm)

Implied turning point: 30.3 μg/m³

NOTE: The implied turning point is reported as a descriptive quantity
derived from point estimates and should not be interpreted as a
precisely identified threshold. No confidence interval is computed.
