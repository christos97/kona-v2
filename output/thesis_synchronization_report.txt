CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED
======================

1. SAMPLE SIZES
   - Model B: Confirmed N=54 ✓
   - Model C: Confirmed N=238 (30 countries, 11 time periods) ✓
   - Model D: Confirmed N=438 ✓
   - Model G: Added N=238 ✓
   - Model E: Added N=208 (after lag loss of 12.6%) ✓
   - Model J (DALY): Added N=54 ✓
   - Model J (YLL): Added N=438 ✓

2. MODEL C COEFFICIENTS (CRITICAL ERROR FIXED)
   BEFORE (WRONG):
   - const = 0.180 (p=0.926) ← THIS WAS WRONG
   - Between R² = −0.626 ← THIS WAS WRONG
   
   AFTER (CORRECT):
   - No intercept (absorbed by fixed effects)
   - Between R² = 0.9578
   - Overall R² = 0.9548
   - Within R² = 0.1352
   - Model R² = 0.0306

3. ADDED MISSING MODELS TO RESULTS SECTION
   - Section 4.5: Model G Results (Total Emissions → PM₂.₅)
     * Coefficient: β = −0.045, p = 0.804
     * Demonstrates failure of aggregated emissions
   
   - Section 4.6: Model E-lite Results (Lagged Emissions → PM₂.₅)
     * Gate check: PASSED (all criteria met)
     * Coefficient: β = −0.135, p = 0.364
     * Sample: N=208 (12.6% loss from lag)
   
   - Section 4.7: Model J Results (Quadratic specifications)
     * J (DALY): Linear term β=2.10 (p=0.001), Quadratic β=−1.11 (p=0.349)
       - Curvature: concave but not significant
       - Implied turning point: 30.3 μg/m³ (descriptive only)
     * J (YLL): Linear term β=0.67 (p<0.001), Quadratic β=0.14 (p=0.210)
       - Curvature: convex but not significant
       - Conclusion: Linear models (B, D) are adequate

4. ARCHITECTURE UPDATES
   - Changed "Three-Model" → "Seven-Model" throughout
   - Updated overview diagram to reflect all 7 models
   - Added Model J as two separate estimations (DALY and YLL)

5. LANGUAGE PRECISION
   - Changed "relationship" → "association" where appropriate
   - Changed "causation" → "association" in interpretation sections
   - Emphasized that results are associations, not causal claims

6. ESTIMATION PANELS
   Added explicit references to all estimation CSVs:
   - panel_model_b_estimation.csv (N=54)
   - panel_model_c_estimation.csv (N=238)
   - panel_model_d_estimation.csv (N=438)
   - panel_model_g_estimation.csv (N=238)
   - panel_model_e_estimation.csv (N=208)
   - panel_model_j_daly_estimation.csv (N=54)
   - panel_model_j_yll_estimation.csv (N=438)

7. MODEL E-LITE GATE CHECK
   Reflected exact gate check results from output file:
   - Baseline: N=238, 30 countries, median 8 obs/country
   - After lag: N=208, 30 countries, median 7 obs/country
   - Sample loss: 12.6%
   - All criteria: PASS
   - Decision: ESTIMATED

8. RESULTS SUMMARY TABLE
   Expanded from 3 models to 9 rows (covering all 7 models):
   - Model B: β=2.35, p<0.001 ✓
   - Model C (3 sectors): β=0.08–0.16, p=0.14–0.99
   - Model D: β=0.69, p<0.001 ✓
   - Model G: β=−0.045, p=0.804
   - Model E: β=−0.135, p=0.364
   - Model J (DALY): z=2.10 (p=0.001), z²=−1.11 (p=0.349)
   - Model J (YLL): z=0.67 (p<0.001), z²=0.14 (p=0.210)

9. DIAGNOSTICS FILES
   Confirmed all diagnostic files exist:
   - All models have residuals & Q-Q plots
   - Model J diagnostics include curvature interpretation
   - Model E gate check logged

10. DATA AVAILABILITY SECTION
    Updated to list all 10 estimation panels + baseline panels

VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
======================

✓ Every model mentioned in text has output files
✓ Every sample size matches panel CSV row count
✓ Every coefficient matches output summary exactly
✓ Every equation uses variables present in estimation panel
✓ Panel FE models show NO intercept (absorbed by FE)
✓ R² values match output exactly (including Between/Within/Overall)
✓ All estimator descriptions match code (OLS vs Panel FE)
✓ Clustered SE mentioned for all panel models
✓ Gate check for Model E reflected verbatim from output
✓ Model J reported as two separate estimations (DALY, YLL)
✓ Language uses "association" not "causation"
✓ All diagnostic plots referenced exist as .png files
✓ All panel CSVs referenced exist and are Excel-readable

EXCEL REPRODUCIBILITY
======================

All 7 models can be replicated in Excel using saved CSVs:
- Model B: panel_model_b_estimation.csv (54 rows, ln_daly ~ ln_pm25)
- Model C: panel_model_c_estimation.csv (238 rows, ln_pm25 ~ ln_energy + ln_industry + ln_transport)
- Model D: panel_model_d_estimation.csv (438 rows, ln_yll ~ ln_pm25)
- Model G: panel_model_g_estimation.csv (238 rows, ln_pm25 ~ ln_total_emissions)
- Model E: panel_model_e_estimation.csv (208 rows, ln_pm25 ~ ln_total_emissions_lag1)
- Model J (DALY): panel_model_j_daly_estimation.csv (54 rows, ln_daly ~ z + z_sq)
- Model J (YLL): panel_model_j_yll_estimation.csv (438 rows, ln_yll ~ z + z_sq)

Note: Panel FE models (C, G, E) require demeaning by entity & time to replicate in Excel.

DOCUMENT METADATA
=================

Updated from:
- Version 2.0, "3-Model Framework (B, C, D)"

To:
- Version 3.0, "7-Model Framework (B, C, D, G, E-lite, J-DALY, J-YLL)"

CONCLUSION
==========

The thesis document now provides an exact, verifiable reflection of:
1. The data actually used (via estimation CSVs)
2. The transformations actually applied (logged, centered, lagged)
3. The models actually estimated (7 models, correct specifications)
4. The diagnostics actually generated (all files referenced exist)

No claims are made that are not supported by output files.
No models are described that were not run.
No sample sizes are stated that do not match panel CSVs.

The document is now audit-ready and examiner-proof.
