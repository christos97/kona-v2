## **Opening Frame (≈1 minute)**

"I will begin by outlining the research question, the analytical structure, and then summarise the main empirical findings."

This thesis examines the empirical relationship between climate-relevant emissions, ambient air quality, and population health burden in Europe over the period 1990–2023. The motivation is the frequent policy claim that climate mitigation yields health co-benefits, and the need to evaluate whether this framing is empirically supported—without making causal claims.

The thesis focuses on PM₂.₅ exposure, given its established relevance for public health, and uses population-weighted national data to align exposure with aggregate health outcomes. Importantly, the thesis adopts a seven-model architecture rather than a single reduced-form model. This design is intentional: it separates the hypothesised pathway into two distinct empirical links—emissions to PM₂.₅, and PM₂.₅ to health outcomes—so that each can be evaluated independently, without imposing untested mediation assumptions.

## **Health Findings (Models B, D, J) (≈2 minutes)**

I first examine the association between PM₂.₅ exposure and health burden.

Model B estimates the relationship between PM₂.₅ and DALYs, capturing both mortality and morbidity. It yields an elasticity of β = 2.35, statistically significant at p < 0.001, based on 54 observations. This indicates a strong association between ambient air quality and overall health burden.

Model D focuses on Years of Life Lost, a mortality-only outcome, using a much larger sample of 438 observations. The estimated elasticity is β = 0.69, again highly significant at p < 0.001. The difference in magnitude between DALYs and YLLs is expected, because DALYs include non-fatal chronic disease through disability weighting, whereas YLLs capture mortality alone.

Model J tests whether these relationships are non-linear by including quadratic terms. In both DALY and YLL specifications, the quadratic terms are statistically insignificant, while the linear PM₂.₅ terms remain significant. This result validates the use of linear specifications in the main models and indicates no strong evidence of curvature over the observed exposure range.

Taken together, these three models demonstrate robust PM₂.₅–health associations across:

- two outcome constructs (DALYs and YLLs),
- two sample sizes,
- and multiple functional forms.

All interpretations are framed explicitly as statistical associations, not causal effects.

## **Emissions Findings (Models C, G, E-lite) (≈2 minutes)**

The second part of the analysis examines whether national emissions inventories predict national mean PM₂.₅.

Model C uses sectoral emissions—energy, industry, and transport—under two-way fixed effects. The estimated coefficients for energy (~+0.08) and industry (~+0.16) are directionally positive, consistent with combustion sources, but not statistically significant.

Models G and E-lite extend this analysis. Model G aggregates emissions across sectors, while Model E-lite introduces a one-year lag and applies explicit gate criteria to preserve sample validity. Both models also yield null or near-zero coefficients.

Crucially, these results are interpreted as statistical constraint, not physical irrelevance. Two-way fixed effects absorb persistent cross-country differences, and approximately 97% of PM₂.₅ variation lies between countries rather than within countries over time. Combined with transboundary pollution, secondary aerosol formation, and spatial heterogeneity, this severely limits emissions attribution at the national-annual scale.

The thesis treats these null findings as informative negative results, demonstrating where attribution breaks down under coarse resolution.

## **Coexistence Argument (≈1 minute)**

A central conclusion of the thesis is that robust health associations and constrained emissions attribution coexist.

This is not a contradiction. The health models exploit cross-country variation in PM₂.₅, where statistical power exists, while the emissions models rely on within-country temporal variation, which is limited under this design. The seven-model architecture makes this separation explicit rather than obscuring it in a single reduced-form estimate.

In this sense, the architecture itself is a contribution: it shows where inference is reliable and where it is constrained, and why.

## **Guardrails and Closing (≈1 minute)**

Throughout the thesis, strict inferential guardrails are maintained.

The thesis does not claim:

- causal effects of emissions reductions,
- counterfactual health gains,
- policy effectiveness,
- or threshold values for PM₂.₅.

These boundaries are embedded structurally: through wording choices such as "statistically associated," through dedicated "What These Results Do Not Identify" sections, and through the conclusions framing.

In summary, the thesis demonstrates that PM₂.₅ exposure is robustly associated with population health burden in Europe, while also transparently documenting the statistical limits of emissions attribution at national-annual resolution. This supports the public-health relevance of air-quality monitoring and sectoral emissions analysis, without over-extending inference beyond what the data support.

## **Notes on Delivery**

### **Timing Calibration**

- Current structure is well-calibrated for ~7 minutes
- Including β values, N, and p-values once per block is optimal density
- Do not add more numbers

### **Visual Aid References**

- Do not verbally reference figure numbers unless explicitly asked
- Examiners can see slides
- Verbal references interrupt flow and invite unnecessary follow-ups

### **Examiner-Anticipation Tone**

- Guardrails embedded lightly, not defensively
- Do not pre-emptively answer trick questions in main narrative
- Save authoritative responses for Q&A, where they have more impact
