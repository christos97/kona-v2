## **Executive Summary: The Dual Imperative of Climate Action and Public Health in Europe**

This report provides a definitive analysis of the synergistic co-benefits realized from climate mitigation and public health policies in Europe over the 1990-2023 period. The analysis establishes that while greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and air pollution, specifically fine particulate matter ($PM_{2.5}$), stem from common drivers—notably fossil fuel combustion—the statistical relationship between them is complex and non-linear. The evidence demonstrates that total GHG emissions are a flawed and inadequate proxy for $PM_{2.5}$ concentrations, a methodological finding with significant policy implications.  
The European Union (EU) has achieved remarkable, parallel success on both fronts. Net GHG emissions in the EU fell by a significant 36% between 1990 and 2023\.1 This decarbonization trend has been mirrored by profound public health gains: between 2005 and 2022, the number of premature deaths attributable to $PM_{2.5}$ exposure in the EU fell by 45%.2  
Despite this progress, the public health burden remains substantial. In 2022 alone, an estimated 239,000 premature deaths in the EU-27 were attributable to exposure to $PM_{2.5}$ concentrations exceeding World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines.2 This mortality burden is part of a larger morbidity and mortality crisis, costing an estimated 2.7 million Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) in Europe in 2022\.3  
This report validates the causal link between air pollution and mortality econometrically, centering on the benchmark Tümay (2025) study. Using a robust fixed-effects panel regression, this analysis establishes a significant elasticity: a 1% increase in $PM_{2.5}$ concentrations is causally associated with a 1.9% increase in premature deaths in the EU-27, after controlling for other key economic and demographic factors.4 This finding provides policymakers with a powerful, validated tool to quantify and monetize the immediate public health returns of climate action, effectively reframing decarbonization as a frontline public health intervention.  
This entire analysis is contextualized within the European Green Deal and its Zero Pollution Action Plan (ZPAP). The ZPAP institutionalizes this co-benefit framework by setting a formal target: a 55% reduction in the health impacts (premature deaths) of air pollution by 2030, relative to 2005 levels.5 The EU is currently on track to meet this goal.2  
Finally, a detailed case study of Greece demonstrates these principles in a national context. Greece achieved a 30.82% reduction in GHG emissions (1990-2023) 7 and saw a corresponding 48.9% reduction in $PM_{2.5}$-attributable mortality in its capital region of Attica between 2007 and 2018\.8 The Greek case also highlights significant, untapped co-benefits in the transport and residential heating sectors, with one study finding that targeted policies could provide 13.5 times more health benefits to low-socioeconomic status groups, revealing a powerful health equity dimension to climate policy.9

## **I. The Climate-Health Co-Benefits Nexus: A Framework for Policy**

### **A. Systemic Drivers: Linking Fossil Fuel Dependency, Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), and Climate Change**

The foundational premise of this report is that climate change and the contemporary public health crisis of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are not separate challenges but are instead intertwined outcomes of the same systemic drivers.10 NCDs represent the dominant health burden in the developed world, accounting for 88% of all deaths among OECD countries.10  
The primary shared driver is a global economic and social model built on fossil fuel dependency. This dependency manifests in key sectors:

* Energy Production: Fossil fuel combustion for electricity and heat is the single largest source of global GHG emissions and a major source of air pollutants.11  
* Transportation: Car-centric urban and interurban transport systems built around the internal combustion engine.10  
* Food Systems: Industrialized food production and long-distance supply chains that are both energy- and emission-intensive.10

These systems are the principal "co-emitters." The combustion of fossil fuels (e.g., coal, oil, gas) and biomass releases both long-lived greenhouse gases (like $CO_2$) that drive climate change, and a cocktail of health-damaging air pollutants that drive NCDs. These pollutants include fine particulate matter ($PM_{2.5}$), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), and short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) like black carbon.11  
This "co-emitter" principle establishes the logical basis for the "co-benefits" framework: any policy action to mitigate climate change by reducing GHG emissions from these shared sources will, by definition, simultaneously reduce co-emitted air pollutants. This yields immediate and localized positive consequences for public health.11

### **B. Defining the Co-Benefit Pathway: From GHG Mitigation to Public Health Gains**

The co-benefit pathway translates this theoretical link into practical policy scenarios. The OECD identifies three key demand-side sectors that are responsible for the vast majority of GHG emissions in member countries: food systems (approximately one-third), passenger transport (one-quarter), and household energy use (one-fifth).10  
Policy interventions in these three sectors create unambiguous "win-win" scenarios that deliver both climate and health benefits:

* Food and Agriculture: Policies that promote a shift toward healthy, sustainably produced "win-win" diets reduce emissions from agriculture (a major source of methane and $N_2O$) while also tackling diet-related NCDs like heart disease and diabetes.10  
* Transportation: Policies that encourage a modal shift away from private vehicles to active transport (walking and cycling) not only cut transport emissions but also yield immense health benefits by encouraging physical activity.10 Similarly, promoting cleaner transportation, such as electric vehicles powered by renewable energy, directly addresses both $CO_2$ emissions and urban air pollution from NOx and $PM_{2.5}$.11  
* Household Energy: Transitioning households away from polluting fuels like coal and biomass for heating, and improving the energy efficiency of buildings, is a cornerstone of climate policy.11 The revised Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (2023), for example, targets a 60% emission reduction in the building sector by 2030\.13 This action directly reduces indoor and outdoor air pollution, which is a major driver of respiratory illness.11

This framework allows governments to break down traditional policy silos. By embedding environmental considerations directly into public health strategy, and vice-versa, policymakers can create mutually reinforcing policies that strengthen health system resilience while accelerating decarbonization efforts.10

### **C. The Strategic Reframing of Climate Policy**

The co-benefits framework is not merely an academic observation; it is a powerful political communication and policy justification tool. Climate change is often perceived by the public as a distant, abstract, and global threat. The catastrophic impacts are projected to occur over decades, making it difficult to motivate the public and policymakers to accept immediate, and often costly, abatement measures.  
The public health consequences of air pollution, however, are immediate, local, and highly personal. The drivers of NCDs—such as respiratory illness, asthma, stroke, and heart disease—are tangible threats to communities, families, and individuals today.10  
By framing climate mitigation policy as a public health intervention, the political calculus changes. The high upfront cost of decarbonization (e.g., retrofitting power plants, subsidizing EVs) is no longer a "cost" to be borne for a distant climate goal. It is an investment with an immediate, quantifiable, and monetizable return. This return is measured in reduced hospital admissions, lower healthcare expenditures, fewer lost work days, and, most importantly, lives saved.15 The health co-benefit is the immediate dividend on the long-term climate investment, making ambitious climate action politically salient and economically sound.

## **II. Europe's Decarbonization Trajectory and Air Quality Trends (1990-2023)**

### **A. An Analysis of European GHG Emission Reductions (EEA & UNFCCC Data)**

The European Union has demonstrated one of the world's most successful examples of decoupling economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions. Based on the latest data from the European Environment Agency (EEA), net GHG emissions in the EU (including international transport) fell by 36% between 1990 and 2023\.1  
This robust, long-term trend is validated by the official annual greenhouse gas inventories submitted by the EU and its Member States to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).17 While the bloc as a whole has been successful, progress varies by Member State. For example, by 2021, Germany had achieved a 39.23% reduction from its base year, while Greece had achieved a 25.48% reduction.20 This comprehensive data infrastructure 22 provides a high-confidence baseline for quantifying the "climate" side of the co-benefit equation.

### **B. The Non-Linear Relationship: Why Total GHGs are a Flawed Proxy for PM2.5**

It is a common and critical methodological error to assume that "total GHG emissions" can serve as a simple, 1-to-1 proxy for air pollutant concentrations. The data conclusively shows this relationship is complex, non-linear, and sector-dependent.24 Using GHGs as a proxy for $PM_{2.5}$ masks underlying risks and leads to flawed policymaking.  
There are three primary reasons for this decoupling:

1. Different Chemical Components: $PM_{2.5}$ is not a single substance. It is a "broad class of chemically and physically diverse" particles.25 It includes primary $PM_{2.5}$ (e.g., soot from combustion) and secondary $PM_{2.5}$, which forms in the atmosphere from chemical reactions between precursor gases like sulfur dioxide ($SO_2$), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and ammonia ($NH_3$).25 Total GHGs, by contrast, are dominated by a different gas, Carbon Dioxide ($CO_2$), with other contributions from methane ($CH_4$) and nitrous oxide ($N_2O$).27  
2. Different Sectoral Sources: The economic sectors that emit these different substances do not perfectly align.  
   * Energy & Industry: This is the primary co-emitter sector. Burning fossil fuels releases $CO_2$ (GHG) alongside $SO_2$ and NOx (PM precursors).12  
   * Agriculture: This sector is a major source of GHGs (methane from livestock, $N_2O$ from fertilizer) but is the dominant source of one specific PM precursor: around 90% of all ammonia ($NH_3$) emissions come from agriculture.26 A climate policy focused exclusively on $CO_2$ from energy would completely fail to address this major source of $PM_{2.5}$ pollution.  
   * Transport: This sector is a major co-emitter of $CO_2$ (GHG) and NOx (PM precursor).26  
3. Different Policy Impacts: Because the pollutants are different, they have been targeted by different policies with different levels of success. EU climate policy (like the Emissions Trading System) targets GHGs. By contrast, air quality policies like the Ambient Air Quality Directives (AAQD) and the National Emission reduction Commitments Directive (NECD) target $PM_{2.5}$ and its precursors (NOx, $SO_2$, $NH_3$).24

The success of these distinct policies is the ultimate proof of the non-linear relationship. Eurostat data on industrial emissions from 2010 to 2022 shows that emissions of acidifying gases ($SO_2$, NOx) fell by a massive 56%. In the same period, industrial $PM_{2.5}$ emissions fell by 29%, and industrial GHG emissions fell by 26%.30 These divergent rates of decline definitively prove that one pollutant cannot be used as a simple proxy for the other.

### **C. Third-Order Insight: The Policy Blind Spot of Decoupling Trends (e.g., Non-Exhaust Emissions)**

The decoupling of emissions within a single sector, such as transport, reveals a critical policy blind spot that arises from treating climate and health as separate goals.  
The EEA reports that, thanks to decades of policy (e.g., Euro emission standards) and technology (e.g., catalytic converters), emissions of most air pollutants from road transport exhaust have seen dramatic decreases since 1990, with reductions ranging from \-46.1% to \-90.4%.24 This is a clear policy victory.  
However, the very same EEA data reveals a deeply problematic counter-trend: in the same 1990-2022 period, non-exhaust emissions from road transport (i.e., particulate matter from tire, brake, and road abrasion) increased by 61.5%.24  
This exposes a major flaw in siloed policymaking. The primary climate policy for transport is the rapid adoption of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) to eliminate $CO_2$ emissions.31 However, due to their heavy batteries, BEVs are significantly heavier than their internal combustion engine (ICE) counterparts. Increased vehicle weight is a primary driver of increased tire and brake wear, which produces non-exhaust $PM_{2.5}$.  
This creates a scenario where a wildly successful climate policy (mass BEV adoption) could inadvertently exacerbate the public health crisis from non-exhaust $PM_{2.5}$ pollution. The "complex and non-linear relationship" 24 is not just an academic footnote; it is a clear and present policy challenge. Relying on GHG-reduction policies to automatically deliver air quality co-benefits is no longer a viable strategy. Future policies must be integrated, targeting GHGs while simultaneously and explicitly addressing all sources of $PM_{2.5}$, including the rising threat of non-exhaust emissions.

## **III. Quantifying the Public Health Burden: Methodologies and Key Findings**

### **A. The Gold Standard Metrics: A Primer on DALYs, YLLs, and Premature Mortality**

To properly assess the public health co-benefits, it is essential to understand the specific metrics used to quantify the "burden of disease."

* Premature Mortality (Deaths): This is the most straightforward metric. It represents the number of deaths attributable to a specific risk factor (like $PM_{2.5}$ exposure) that occur before a statistical life expectancy.2  
* Years of Life Lost (YLLs): This is a more sophisticated measure of premature mortality. It quantifies the total years of potential life lost due to these premature deaths, estimating the average number of additional years people in a population would have lived had they not died early.2  
* Years Lived with Disability (YLDs): This metric captures the morbidity burden. It measures the impact of living with a non-fatal disease or disability (e.g., asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) caused by the risk factor.34  
* Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs): This is the gold-standard summary metric for the total burden of disease, used by the WHO and GBD. It provides a single, comprehensive figure by combining mortality and morbidity: DALYs \= YLLs \+ YLDs.2 A DALY represents one lost year of "healthy life."

For the specific case of ambient air pollution, the burden is overwhelmingly driven by mortality. Analyses for the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study have shown that YLLs (mortality) can contribute as much as 97% of the total DALYs from ambient $PM_{2.5}$ exposure.35 This highlights that while morbidity is a significant concern, premature death is the dominant public health impact.

### **B. Landmark Data Infrastructures: A Comparative Analysis of IHME GBD, WHO, and EEA Methodologies**

Policymakers are often confronted with different health burden statistics from different high-profile organizations. These are not contradictions; they are the result of different methodologies, data sources, and purposes. Understanding these differences is a hallmark of expert analysis.

* World Health Organization (WHO): The WHO acts as the global standard-setter and primary data collector. It maintains the Ambient Air Quality Database, which compiles ground-level measurements from over 8,600 human settlements worldwide.36 It also provides the AirQ+ software, a health risk assessment tool used by many public health agencies and researchers to calculate health impacts based on local air quality data.38 This tool was used, for example, in the detailed 2022 study of the Attica region in Greece.8  
* Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME): The IHME produces the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, which is the largest and most comprehensive academic effort to quantify health loss across all causes and risks.39 Using a systematic analysis of 328,938 data sources, the GBD provides standardized, comparable estimates of DALYs and YLLs for 88 risk factors (including $PM_{2.5}$) across 204 countries, with data stretching from 1990 to 2021\.39 The unique value of GBD is comparison: it allows policymakers to see the burden of air pollution ranked against other major risks like smoking, high blood pressure, and poor diet.42  
* European Environment Agency (EEA): The EEA is the EU's official body for monitoring environmental status and policy progress. Its annual "Harm to human health from air pollution" briefing 2 is not a new epidemiological study. Instead, it is a specialized health risk assessment that applies the WHO-recommended methodologies 33 to the latest, fully-validated European air quality monitoring data.2

The different approaches inevitably lead to different headline numbers. A 2022 analysis provides a direct comparison for Germany in 2018:

* The EEA reported 63,100 deaths and 710,900 YLLs attributable to $PM_{2.5}$.34  
* The IHME GBD study reported 26,592 deaths and 430,491 YLLs for the same country and year.34

This discrepancy is explained by the different models and, crucially, different input data. For example, the GBD-2019 study estimated 65,550 stroke deaths per year for Germany, while official German statistics (used in other models) cited 30,975.34 The GBD study also incorporates a wider range of uncertainties for virtually every input variable, resulting in broader uncertainty intervals.34  
Neither number is "wrong." The EEA figure is the official metric used by the European Commission to track progress against the Zero Pollution Action Plan.32 The IHME figure is the academic standard for comparing Germany's air pollution burden against all other health risks in a globally standardized framework.

### **C. The European Health Burden in 2022-2024: A Statistical Review**

This section presents the definitive headline figures from the most recent reports, using the appropriate metric from each source.  
EEA (2024 Report, based on 2022 data):

* Premature Deaths (EU-27):  
  * 239,000 deaths were attributable to exposure to $PM_{2.5}$ concentrations above the 2021 WHO guideline level (5 $\\mu g/m^3$).2 The 95% confidence interval (CI) was 182,000–267,000.  
  * 48,000 deaths were attributable to exposure to nitrogen dioxide ($NO_2$).2  
  * 70,000 deaths were attributable to exposure to ozone ($O_3$).2  
* Geographic Disparity: The highest relative health impacts, measured in YLLs per 100,000 inhabitants, were observed in south-eastern European countries. Within the EU-27, the highest relative impacts were in Bulgaria, Poland, and Romania.2

IHME GBD & Related Studies (based on 2021/2022 data):

* Global Burden: Globally in 2021, ambient $PM_{2.5}$ exposure contributed to 7.83 million deaths and 231.51 million DALYs.45  
* European Burden (DALYs): In 2022, air pollution caused a total of over 2.7 million DALYs in Europe, with $PM_{2.5}$ confirmed as the leading contributor to this disease burden.3  
* Disease-Specific Burden: The largest share of the $PM_{2.5}$ burden in Europe resulted from ischemic heart disease (764,479 DALYs), while the highest burden from $NO_2$ resulted from diabetes (313,491 DALYs).3

## **IV. Econometric Validation: Modeling the Impact of PM2.5 on Public Health**

### **A. Isolating the Causal Effect: The Power of Panel Data and Fixed-Effects Regression**

The data presented in Section II established a strong correlation: GHG emissions and $PM_{2.5}$-attributable deaths have both declined significantly in Europe. However, for effective policymaking, correlation is insufficient. We must establish causation.  
A simple regression analysis comparing pollution levels and death rates across countries is highly susceptible to Omitted Variable Bias (OVB).46 For example, wealthier nations tend to have both stricter environmental regulations (and thus cleaner air) and more advanced healthcare systems (and thus lower mortality). A simple model might incorrectly attribute the low mortality rates to the clean air, when the effect is actually due to the high-quality hospitals. This unmeasured factor (healthcare quality) is the omitted variable.  
To solve this, environmental econometricians employ Panel Data Fixed-Effects (FE) Regression models.31 This is the gold standard for robust policy analysis.

1. Panel Data: The model observes many different units (e.g., the 27 EU countries) over a long period of time (e.g., 2007-2019).4  
2. Fixed Effects: The "fixed effect" is a statistical tool that effectively controls for all stable, time-invariant, and unobservable characteristics of each country.49 This includes its geography, political structure, culture, and the baseline quality of its health system.

By using an FE model, the analysis "soaks up" all these confounding background factors. It isolates the true causal relationship by asking a more precise question: within a single country (holding its unique characteristics constant), what is the effect of a change in its $PM_{2.5}$ level on a change in its mortality rate? This method allows for the identification of a causal link rather than simple correlation.

### **B. The Tümay (2025) Benchmark: An Elasticity of 1.9% for Premature Mortality**

A benchmark 2025 study, "Air pollution and premature deaths: A panel analysis of $PM_{2.5}$ effects in Europe" by Muhammed Tümay, provides the precise econometric validation for this report's framework.4

* Study Design: The research utilizes a robust fixed-effect (FE) panel regression.4  
* Data: The panel covers the EU-27 countries over the period 2007 to 2019\.4  
* Controls: To ensure the model's robustness and further mitigate OVB, the analysis includes several critical time-varying economic and demographic control variables: healthcare expenditure (as a % of GDP), income distribution (Gini), healthy life expectancy at age 65, fertility rates, and total deaths.4  
* The Core Finding (Elasticity): The analysis reveals a statistically significant and positive impact of $PM_{2.5}$ on premature mortality. The key finding is an elasticity: a 1% increase in $PM_{2.5}$ concentrations is found to cause a 1.9% increase in premature deaths.4

### **C. The "Tümay Elasticity" as a Policy Modeling Tool**

The 1.9% elasticity identified by Tümay (2025) is far more than an academic finding; it is a critical tool for practical policy modeling and ex-ante (forward-looking) evaluation.  
Policy advisors are constantly required to assess the costs and benefits of proposed regulations. This 1.9 elasticity 4 serves as a validated multiplier that can be directly integrated into impact assessment models.  
For example, a policymaker can now take a proposed climate regulation—such as the revised Energy Performance of Buildings Directive 13 or a new standard for industrial emissions—that is projected by atmospheric models to reduce ambient $PM_{2.5}$ concentrations by an average of 10%. By applying the 1.9 elasticity (10% $\\times$ 1.9 \= 19%), the policymaker can now robustly estimate that this single regulation will yield a 19% reduction in premature deaths attributable to this specific pollution vector.  
This calculation, grounded in a causal econometric model, allows for the formal monetization of the health co-benefits. This process transforms a regulation's "environmental cost" into a quantifiable "public health investment" with a clear, high, and immediate return, substantially strengthening the economic case for its implementation.15

### **D. European Cohort Studies: Deep-Dive Evidence from the ELAPSE Project**

The macro-level, top-down econometric findings from Tümay (2025) are powerfully validated by micro-level, bottom-up epidemiological cohort studies. The most significant of these is the ELAPSE (Effects of Low-Level Air Pollution: a Study in Europe) project.50  
The ELAPSE study pooled data from 22 large European cohorts, developing new high-resolution (100m $\\times$ 100m) exposure models for $PM_{2.5}$, black carbon (BC), $NO_2$, and ozone.50 Its findings are crucial for two reasons:

1. Confirmation of Association: The study confirmed significant associations between long-term exposure to $PM_{2.5}$, $NO_2$, and BC and several causes of death, including natural-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality.50  
2. The "No Safe Level" Finding: Most importantly, the study examined the shape of the concentration-response curve. It found "steeper slopes at lower exposures, with no evidence of concentrations below which no associations were found".50

This "no safe level" finding is a critical piece of scientific evidence. It implies that there is no threshold of air quality (e.g., an old, weaker EU standard) below which the air is "safe." Even for European countries and cities that are already in compliance with older standards, every single incremental reduction in $PM_{2.5}$ concentration still yields significant, measurable public health benefits. This finding provides the definitive scientific justification for the EU's recent move to align its air quality standards much more closely with the stricter WHO guidelines.2

### **E. Scenario Modeling: Projecting Future Health Gains from Ambitious Mitigation**

Looking forward, integrated assessment models (IAMs) that project future climate and health pathways confirm the immense scale of the co-benefit opportunity.

* SSP Scenarios: Studies utilizing the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios, which model future development, provide a stark choice. One study, modeling 1,366 regions of Europe, found that under an ambitious, sustainable scenario (SSP1-2.6), over 90% of the European population could meet the WHO guideline value for $PM_{2.5}$ by 2100\. Conversely, under a high-emission, low-mitigation scenario (SSP3-7.0), less than 10% of the population would meet this guideline.54 This would result in 282,000 premature deaths annually by the end of the century, versus 67,000 in the ambitious scenario.54  
* Monetized Benefits: The economic case is equally stark. A 2024 study published in Science Advances quantified the immediate co-benefits of pursuing stringent net-zero policies designed to avoid a temporary overshoot of the 1.5°C temperature limit. It found these policies would prevent 207,000 premature deaths and save $2,269 billion USD in economic damages by 2030 alone, purely from the air quality co-benefits.15 This provides a powerful economic rationale for ambitious climate action, demonstrating that the short-term health savings can substantially offset the mitigation costs.16

## **V. Policy in Action: The European Green Deal and the Zero Pollution Framework**

### **A. The Zero Pollution Action Plan: Aligning Climate and Health Targets**

The co-benefits framework is not just a theoretical concept; it is the explicit, foundational doctrine of current EU environmental policy. The overarching strategy is the European Green Deal, which aims to make Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050\.55  
A key deliverable of the Green Deal is the EU Action Plan: "Towards a Zero Pollution for Air, Water and Soil".5 This plan formally institutionalizes the co-benefit nexus. The European Environment Agency (EEA) states that the plan "acknowledges these multiple linkages and frames its zero pollution ambition as a necessary complement to the EU's 2050 climate-neutrality goal".56 This moves the co-benefit idea from a research finding to a core EU policy doctrine, recognizing that climate and pollution goals are synergistic and must be pursued jointly.11

### **B. The 55% Target: A Quantified Public Health Goal**

The Zero Pollution Action Plan (ZPAP) is defined by a set of concrete, measurable 2030 targets. The headline target directly addresses the health burden metrics outlined in this report.

* The Target: To reduce by more than 55% the health impacts (premature deaths) of air pollution by 2030, compared to a 2005 baseline.5

This target aligns climate neutrality (the Green Deal's 55% GHG reduction target) with a parallel 55% public health improvement target. This alignment provides a clear, measurable, and synergistic policy objective for the entire European Commission.

* Progress: The EU is firmly on track to achieve this public health goal. The EEA's 2024 briefing, which serves as the official monitor for this target, confirmed that by 2022, the number of premature deaths in the EU attributable to $PM_{2.5}$ had already fallen by 45% since the 2005 baseline.2  
* Policy Reinforcement: This progress is being locked in and accelerated. In December 2024, the revised Ambient Air Quality Directive (AAQD) entered into force. This directive is a critical step, as it cuts the allowed annual limit value for $PM_{2.5}$ by more than half, aligning EU standards much more closely with the scientifically-backed WHO recommendations and setting the EU on a clear trajectory to achieve the zero pollution objective by 2050\.53

### **C. Linking the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**

This integrated EU framework provides a powerful mechanism for achieving multiple UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) simultaneously, demonstrating a "whole-of-government" approach.

* SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being): The ZPAP's 55% mortality reduction target is a direct implementation of SDG Target 3.9: "By 2030, substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution and contamination".58  
* SDG 13 (Climate Action): The underlying policies driving the ZPAP—such as transitioning to renewable energy, greening transport, and decarbonizing industry—are the primary mechanisms for achieving SDG 13\.55  
* SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities): The entire framework is built on improving urban livability. The WHO's Ambient Air Quality Database, which tracks urban pollution, is the official data source used to measure SDG Indicator 11.6.2 (Air quality in cities).36

## **VI. National-Level Application: A Case Study of Greece**

This section provides a "vertical integration" of the report's themes, applying the EU-level framework, data methodologies, and econometric principles to a specific Member State: Greece.

### **A. Greece's Emission Profile: GHG and PM2.5 Trends (1990-2023)**

Greece's national data mirrors the broader European trends of success and remaining challenges.

* GHG Emissions: Greece's annual National Inventory Reports, submitted to the UNFCCC, provide a clear and detailed trend.7  
  * 1990 Base Year: Total GHG emissions (with LULUCF) were 103.99 Mt $CO_2$-equivalent.7  
  * 2021: Emissions had fallen to 77.49 Mt $CO_2$-equivalent.20  
  * 2023: Emissions (without LULUCF) were 71.93 Mt $CO_2$-equivalent.7  
  * Trend: This represents a 30.82% decrease in total GHG emissions (without LULUCF) from 1990 to 2023\.7  
* $PM_{2.5}$ Concentrations: Greece has seen significant improvements in air quality, particularly in major urban areas like Athens and Thessaloniki, which historically faced acute pollution.44 A 2022 study analyzing $PM_{2.5}$ concentrations in the Attica region from 2007 to 2018 confirmed a clear decreasing trend. However, it also noted that levels in 2018 still exceeded the new, stricter WHO Air Quality Guideline (AQG) limit of 5 $\\mu g/m^3$.8

### **B. Quantifying the Attributable Health Burden in Greece**

Multiple data sources, from the national to the regional level, quantify the health burden of air pollution in Greece and the success of mitigation policies.

* National Level (WHO): The WHO's 2025 "Health and Environment Scorecard" for Greece identified 6,030 deaths attributable to stroke and ischaemic heart disease caused by air pollution.65  
* Regional Level (WHO AirQ+ Study): The most detailed, localized data comes from a 2022 study that applied the WHO's AirQ+ software 38 to the Attica Region (which includes Athens). This study provides a perfect, granular example of the co-benefits in action over an 11-year period.  
  * The Finding: The total burden of mortality (from all-natural causes) associated with $PM_{2.5}$ exposure in people over 30 years old fell from 4,752 deaths in 2007 to 2,424 deaths in 2018\.8 This is a 48.9% reduction in the mortality burden in just over a decade, a profound public health victory.

### **C. Local Co-Benefit Opportunities and the Equity Dimension**

While celebrating this success, the data also points to significant, untapped opportunities for future co-benefit policies in Greece, particularly in the transport and residential sectors. These opportunities carry a powerful equity dimension.

* Transport Sector: A 2016 study modeled the promotion of 'green' transportation (e.g., electric vehicles) in a Greek city. It found clear, monetizable co-benefits. The reduction in exposure to $PM_{2.5}$, $PM_{10}$, and $NO_2$ alone would provide monetary savings of up to 49.1 million Euros from avoided health costs.66  
* Residential Sector & Health Equity: A 2019 study on residential wood burning in Athens (a key source of $PM_{2.5}$ during economic hardship) provides a critical insight into the distribution of co-benefits.9 The study applied a health impact assessment that specifically considered different socioeconomic status (SES) groups.  
  * The Finding: The analysis found that a policy reducing $PM_{2.5}$ from residential wood burning would benefit the lower-SES groups as much as 13.5 times more than the high-SES group.9  
  * The Rationale: This is because lower-SES populations are often dually vulnerable: they face higher exposure (e.g., due to fuel poverty, forcing reliance on cheaper, polluting fuels like wood) and higher baseline susceptibility to NCDs.  
  * The Implication: This finding is of profound policy importance. It demonstrates that climate mitigation is not just an environmental and health policy; it is a powerful social and health equity policy. A "triple-win" policy, such as providing subsidies for clean heating to low-income households, simultaneously achieves (1) climate mitigation (SDG 13), (2) public health improvement (SDG 3), and (3) a measurable reduction in in-country health disparities (a key component of SDG 3 and SDG 10).

Table 3: Greece Case Study: PM2.5 Attributable Mortality Burden, Attica Region (2007 vs. 2018\)

| Health Endpoint (Attributable to PM2.5​) | 2007 Mortality Burden (95% CI) | 2018 Mortality Burden (95% CI) | Trend (2007-2018) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| All-Natural Causes (\>30 years old) | 4,752 \[3179–6152\] | 2,424 \[1598–3179\] | \-48.9% |
| Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) (\>25) | 8 | 8 | Decreased |
| Stroke (\>25) | 8 | 8 | Decreased |
| COPD (\>25) | 146 \[79–220\] | 147 \[63–244\] | Stable |

Source: Analysis of Attica Region, Greece, using WHO AirQ+ Software.8 The stability of COPD mortality, in contrast to the sharp decline in overall mortality, suggests that while general air quality improved, specific pollution vectors or population vulnerabilities related to COPD remained, highlighting a need for more targeted interventions.

## **VII. Strategic Insights and Policy Recommendations**

The comprehensive analysis of econometric, epidemiological, and policy data from 1990 to 2023 provides a clear, evidence-based path forward. The following strategic recommendations are designed to operationalize these findings, maximizing the public health returns of Europe's climate ambitions.

1. Embrace the Co-Benefit Framework to Justify Climate Action.  
   The evidence is overwhelming that climate change and the public health burden from NCDs are driven by the same fossil fuel-dependent systems.10  
   * Recommendation: Policymakers must cease treating public health and climate policy as separate domains. All climate mitigation policies should be primarily framed and justified using their immediate, local, and monetizable public health co-benefits. The $2.269 trillion in health savings projected by 2030 from ambitious climate action 15, or the 49.1 million Euros in savings from a single city's transport plan 66, are powerful economic arguments that reframe a "climate cost" as a "public health investment."  
2. Move Beyond Flawed Proxies: Target Co-Emitters, Not Just GHGs.  
   This report proves that total GHG emissions are a dangerously flawed proxy for $PM_{2.5}$.24 This is due to divergent sectoral sources (e.g., ammonia from agriculture) and the emerging policy blind spot of non-exhaust emissions from transport, which have risen 61.5%.24  
   * Recommendation: Adopt an integrated "co-emitter" policy framework. All future climate policies must be evaluated for their discrete impacts on $PM_{2.5}$ precursors (NOx, $SO_2$, $NH_3$) and all $PM_{2.5}$ sources (exhaust and non-exhaust). A climate policy that ignores ammonia from agriculture or non-exhaust emissions from BEVs is an incomplete and potentially counterproductive health policy.  
3. Operationalize the "Tümay Elasticity" in Policy Appraisal.  
   The Tümay (2025) study provides a robust, EU-specific econometric elasticity: a 1% $PM_{2.5}$ reduction causes a 1.9% reduction in premature deaths.4 This is a powerful, ready-to-use tool.  
   * Recommendation: Mandate that all ex-ante policy evaluations and Impact Assessments for new energy, transport, and industrial regulations use this (or a similar, locally-calibrated) elasticity. This allows for the formal quantification and monetization of health co-benefits (in DALYs and YLLs saved), ensuring the full, true benefit of climate action is reflected in all cost-benefit analyses.  
4. Leverage Health Equity as a Policy Multiplier.  
   The co-benefits of climate mitigation are not distributed equally. The Greek case study on residential wood burning shows that targeted policies can be up to 13.5 times more beneficial for low-SES and vulnerable groups.9  
   * Recommendation: Prioritize "triple-win" climate interventions that explicitly target health equity. Policies such as clean heating subsidies for low-income households or "green transport" infrastructure in pollution-exposed neighborhoods must be prioritized. These policies simultaneously achieve (1) climate mitigation, (2) maximal public health improvement, and (3) a measurable reduction in social and health inequity.  
5. Accelerate Full Alignment with WHO Guidelines.  
   The scientific evidence from large-scale European cohort studies (ELAPSE) is definitive: there is "no evidence of concentrations below which no associations were found".50 This renders all older, weaker air quality standards scientifically obsolete.  
   * Recommendation: Aggressively implement the new, stricter Ambient Air Quality Directive.53 The WHO guideline of 5 $\\mu g/m^3$ 2 should not be treated as a long-term aspiration but as a non-negotiable public health imperative. The evidence confirms that every microgram of $PM_{2.5}$ reduced delivers a quantifiable, non-zero health and economic return.
